    whatIs: "A legal contract establishing a business relationship between a company and an independent contractor. It defines the scope of work, payment terms, and clarifies that the contractor is not an employee. This distinction is crucial for tax purposes, liability protection, and compliance. The contractor controls how they perform the work, uses their own equipment, can work for others, and handles their own taxes and business expenses.",
    whenToUse: [
      "Hiring freelancers or consultants for specific projects",
      "Engaging specialists for temporary or ongoing work",
      "Outsourcing specific business functions or services",
      "Working with vendors or service providers",
      "When the worker operates their own business"
    ],
    faqs: [
      { q: "Why do I need an Independent Contractor Agreement?", a: "It sets clear expectations, protects intellectual property ownership, maintains confidentiality, defines the scope of work, and most importantly documents that the relationship is independent—not employment. This protects both parties from IRS misclassification penalties." },
      { q: "What's the difference between a contractor and an employee?", a: "Contractors work independently, control how they perform work, use their own equipment, can work for multiple clients, set their own hours, and pay their own taxes and business expenses. Employees work under the hiring party's direction, receive company equipment, work set hours, and have taxes deducted by the employer." },
      { q: "Can I sign an Independent Contractor Agreement online?", a: "Yes, with proper e-signature tools like DocuSign or Hellosign that are legally binding in most jurisdictions. Both parties can sign securely and electronically, making the process faster and more convenient." },
      { q: "Who owns the work created by the contractor?", a: "This should be clearly specified in the contract. Without an explicit clause, the contractor typically retains ownership of work they create. You can assign ownership to yourself through a Work-Made-For-Hire clause if needed." },
      { q: "What happens if a contractor is misclassified?", a: "Misclassification can result in significant IRS penalties, back taxes, unpaid payroll taxes, unemployment insurance liability, and workers' compensation violations. A properly drafted agreement demonstrating true contractor status can provide protection." }

                  Contractor misclassification can result in significant IRS penalties, back taxes, payroll tax liability, and workers' compensation exposure. Ensure your agreement clearly documents the independent nature of the relationship and that the contractor controls how work is performed, uses their own equipment, and handles their own taxes.
