                  Address rent, permitted use, improvements, contingencies, and compliance requirements in your offer to avoid disputes later. A comprehensive offer reduces the need for extensive back-and-forth negotiation.

                <p className="text-green-800 text-sm">
                  Specify exactly what business activities are allowed. Vague language about permitted use may restrict operations or lead to conflicts about business expansion.

                  Add contingencies for property inspections, financing approval, and any other conditions that could affect lease commencement. This protects you from being locked into unfavorable terms.

                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-2">
                  Yes. An Offer to Lease becomes legally binding once accepted by both parties.

                <p className="text-gray-600 text-sm">

                  <li>• Establishes clear commercial expectations before formal lease</li>

                  Once accepted, the offer becomes binding and the parties move toward preparing a formal commercial lease. The offer typically forms the foundation for the detailed lease document.
